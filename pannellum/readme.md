# Pannellum 2.3.2

## About

Pannellum is a lightweight, free, and open source panorama viewer for the web. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and WebGL, it is plug-in free. It can be deployed easily as a single file, just 15kB gzipped, and then embedded into pages as an `<iframe>`. A configuration utility is included to generate the required code for embedding.
